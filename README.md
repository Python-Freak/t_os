# Writing an Operating System in Rust

## Overview
The blog [Writing an Operating System in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) is an extensive resource that guides readers through the process of building an operating system kernel using the Rust programming language. Authored by Philipp Oppermann, this blog series offers in-depth explanations, code samples, and hands-on exercises to help readers understand various concepts related to operating system development.

## Topics Covered
The blog covers a wide range of topics related to operating systems and low-level programming, including but not limited to:
- Introduction to Rust programming language
- Setting up the development environment
- Bootstrapping the kernel
- Memory management
- Interrupt handling
- Hardware abstraction
- Multitasking
- File systems
- Testing and debugging techniques
- And much more

## Target Audience
This blog is primarily aimed at developers interested in systems programming, kernel development, or those seeking to deepen their understanding of operating systems internals. It assumes a basic familiarity with programming concepts and the Rust programming language, although beginners can also benefit from the detailed explanations provided.

## Dependencies
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/): QEMU is a free and open-source emulator. It emulates a computer's processor through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of different hardware and device models for the machine, enabling it to run a variety of guest operating systems.

- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html): Cargo is the Rust package manager. Cargo downloads your Rust package’s dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to crates.io, the Rust community’s package registry. 

## How to Use
- Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Python-Freak/t_os.git
```
- Navigate to directory
```
cd t_os
```
- Run the project
```
cargo run
```

## Additional Resources
- [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/): Official website for the Rust programming language, containing documentation, tutorials, and resources for learning Rust.
- [Philipp Oppermann's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/phil-opp): Contains the source code for the blog's accompanying Rust kernel and other related projects.
- [Rust OSDev](https://os.phil-opp.com/): A community-driven repository of resources for OS development in Rust, featuring tutorials, libraries, and tools.

## Conclusion
"Writing an Operating System in Rust" provides a comprehensive and accessible resource for developers interested in exploring the fascinating world of operating system development using Rust. Whether you're a seasoned systems programmer or a curious beginner, this blog offers valuable insights and practical knowledge to embark on your journey of building your own operating system.
